# The Bittflood History Flooder
Javscript code that will flood your history.
Save the Javascript code as a bookmark, have the URL be the code, and you can name the bookmarklet anything you want. Everytime you click on it, it will ask you how many times you want that page to flood your history, once you hit enter, it will flood it with that page. This makes it extremely hard for someone to check your history and find anything that you are doing which is off task.
